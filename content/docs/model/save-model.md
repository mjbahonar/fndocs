## Save the Model loacly
You can easily save the model to your PC using **WinSCP**.  
To do this, configure your **private key (.ppk)** in WinSCP.  

When creating a new connection, go to the **Advanced** tab, then navigate to `SSH -> Authentication`, and add your private key.

## Upload to Hugginface ü§ó

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create an Account  

First, create an account on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/). 


### Crearing a model
Next, create a model by visiting [this link](https://huggingface.co/new).  
After creation, your model link should look like this: 
 `https://huggingface.co/[YOUR-USERNAME]/[YOUR-MODEL]`

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Sign in to Hugging Face on the Server  

First, generate an **Access Token** on Hugging Face:  

Go to **Account Settings -> Access Tokens -> New Token**  
![Hugging Face Token](token.png) 

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** Ensure the token has all necessary permissions; otherwise, you won't be able to upload, read, or write data from the server.  


Now, install the required library on your server:  

    pip install huggingface_hub

Then, authenticate using your Hugging Face token. Once done, your Hugging Face setup is complete.



### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Uploda your model
Now, run this Python script on your server to upload the model:

```python

from huggingface_hub import HfApi
import os

repo_id = "your-username/your-model-name"  # Change this to your HF repo
lora_weights_path = "/fn/finetune_lora/pokemon/lora_weights"  # Path to saved LoRA weights

# Initialize Hugging Face API
api = HfApi()

# Upload files to Hugging Face
api.upload_folder(
    folder_path=lora_weights_path,
    repo_id=repo_id,
    repo_type="model"
)

print(f"LoRA model uploaded to: https://huggingface.co/{repo_id}")

```
1Ô∏è‚É£ After uploading, visit your model page in a browser to confirm the transfer. This may take time depending on the file size.
 
2Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure `lora_weights_path` points to your latest checkpoint directory

3Ô∏è‚É£ Set `repo_id` to match your Hugging Face account and model.face account.

## Test the model

Once uploaded successfully, test your model using this Python script:

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load base model and LoRA weights
base_model = "runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5"
repo_id = "your-username/your-model-name"

pipeline = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(base_model)
pipeline.load_lora_weights(repo_id, adapter_name="pokemon_lora")

# Move to GPU
pipeline.to("cuda")

# Generate an image
image = pipeline("YOUR PROMPT").images[0]

# Display the image using matplotlib
plt.imshow(image)
plt.axis('off')  # Hide the axis
plt.show()

# Save the image to a file
image.save("generated_PROMPT.png")
print("Image saved as 'generated_PROMPT.png'")

```

The generated image will be saved on the server, and you can download it easily.
